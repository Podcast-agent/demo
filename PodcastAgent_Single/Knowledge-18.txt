Host: Hello everyone and welcome to our Talk Show! Today, we’ve invited two distinguished guests to discuss a prevalent issue - the impact of social media on news consumption and the spread of false information. I’m your host, Jack. Let me introduce our guests.
Host: First, we have Dr. Jessica Newman, a Media Studies Professor from UC Berkeley who has dedicated her career to studying how social media is changing the news landscape. Welcome, Dr. Newman!
Host: And joining us is Brian Shields, a technology analyst and former Facebook Data Scientist who advocates for transparency in social media. Welcome, Brian!
Host: Let's jump right in. Dr. Newman, can you explain how social media platforms have altered the way we consume and share news?
Guest_1: Certainly...
Host: Interesting. Brian, from your perspective at Facebook, how might these changes contribute to spreading misinformation?
Guest_2: That's a very good question...
