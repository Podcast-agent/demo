        <h1>PodAgent: A Comprehensive Framework for Podcast Generation</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Existing automatic audio generation methods struggle to generate podcast-like audio programs effectively. The key challenges lie in in-depth content generation, appropriate and expressive voice production. This paper proposed PodAgent, a comprehensive framework for creating audio programs. PodAgent 1) generates informative topic-discussion content by designing a Host-Guest-Writer multi-agent collaboration system, 2) builds a voice pool for suitable voice-role matching and 3) utilizes LLM-enhanced speech synthesis method to generate expressive conversational speech. Given the absence of standardized evaluation criteria for podcast-like audio generation, we developed comprehensive assessment guidelines to effectively evaluate the model's performance. Experimental results demonstrate PodAgent's effectiveness, significantly surpassing direct GPT-4 generation in topic-discussion dialogue content, achieving an 87.4% voice-matching accuracy, and producing more expressive speech through LLM-guided synthesis.

            Topic: Why might someone choose to use a paper map or ask for directions instead of relying on a GPS device or smartphone app?

            <span class="highlight">[Host]: "Hello and welcome! Today we're going to explore why someone might choose to use a paper map or ask for directions instead of relying on a GPS device or smartphone app. We have two fantastic guests joining us today, John Anderson, a distinguished Professor of Cartography, and Sara Mitchell, a renowned Anthropologist and Tech Critic. Welcome, both of you! Let's dive right into the topic. John, would you like to kick things off?"
            [John Anderson]: "Absolutely, and thank you for having me. In a digital era, paper maps might seem like a thing of the past. But let me assure you, they're very much alive and relevant. Paper maps serve as a reliable source of navigation, especially in remote areas with poor connectivity. Additionally, using paper maps develops a spatial understanding and enhances awareness."
            [Host]: "Interesting! Could you please elaborate on how using a paper map enhances cognitive abilities?"
            [John Anderson]: "Sure. Paper maps require skills like spatial thinking, logical deduction, and problem-solving. You have to interpret symbols, measure distances, and orient yourself. Naturally, this exercise improves mental rotation, spatial visualization, and recall of the route. Even educationally, it offers a practical understanding of the earth's geography."</span>
            [Host]: "That's definitely a perspective to consider. On that note, let's hear what Sara has to say about this. Sara?"
            [Sara Mitchell]: "Well, I associate maps with the charm of independence. You aren't reliant on network signals or batteries. And as someone who critically evaluates the impact of technology on societal behaviors, I worry about the loss of traditional skills like navigation due to our overreliance on GPS devices."
            [Host]: "That certainly is a valid concern. Sara, could you also talk about how asking for directions might impact our social connections?"
            [Sara Mitchell]: "Of course. In times of widespread digital interaction, asking for direction is a refreshing human interaction. It often leads to meaningful conversations, a valuable local perspective, and even unexpected friendships. This organic exchange of knowledge and experiences is absent when we depend solely on GPS."
            [Host]: "John, you'd agree with that, wouldn't you?"
            [John Anderson]: "Absolutely! In fact, a paper map can add to the group dynamics of activities like hiking. You see everyone studying the map together, planning routes, landmarks. It fosters a sense of teamwork and shared responsibility, which no digital device can mimic."
            [Host]: "Sounds like an adventure in itself! Now, while we wrap up, would any of you like to add anything?"
            [Sara Mitchell]: "I'd just like to emphasize how using a paper map or asking for directions can foster cognition. It engages various parts of our brain, enhances memory, and gives us confidence in our navigational skills. So, next time, why not try swapping the screen for a sheet of paper?"
            [Host]: "A fantastic point to end today's discussion, thank you both for your valuable insights. And thank you to our audience for watching. Until next time, stay curious!"        </p>
