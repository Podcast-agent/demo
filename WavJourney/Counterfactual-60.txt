Host: Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to our tonight's show! We are going to discuss an exciting hypothetical scenario today; what if Vincent van Gogh had been a successful artist during his lifetime!
Guest 1: That's an interesting question. I think his work would have been viewed differently, possibly less inspirational.
Guest 2: Absolutely. It might even change the way society views art and artists.
Host: Very thought-provoking insights! Let's continue this discussion after a short break.
Host: Welcome back, let's dive deeper into our topic.
Guest 1: In my opinion, the real value of his work comes from the hardship he faced in life.
Guest 2: I couldn't agree more. His struggle and perseverance have become part of his legacy.
Host: What a fantastic dialogue, thank you both for joining us tonight. Until next time, this is your host signing off!
